What is the Django MVT architecture?
MVT architecture is the software design pattern used by the Django web framework.

MVT stands for Model – View – Template.

1) Model
Provides the interface for the data stored in the database.

2) Template
Templates are responsible for the entire User Interface completely. It handles all the static parts of the webpage along with the HTML, which the users visiting the webpage will perceive. 

3) Views
Views act as a link between the Model data and the Templates. 

Views are responsible for handling all the business logic behind the web app. It acts as a bridge between Models and Templates.

It sees the user request,  retrieves appropriate data from the database, then renders back the template along with retrieved data.

Control Flow of MVT

1.The user sends a URL request for a resource to Django.
2.Django framework then searches for the URL resource.
3.If the URL path links up to a View, then that particular View is called.
4.The View will then interact with the Model and retrieve the appropriate data from the database.
5.The View then renders back an appropriate template along with the retrieved data to the user.
